# ComicMath â€“ AI-Powered Comic Generation for Teaching Mathematics

ComicMath is an innovative AI-powered educational tool designed to teach Grade 9 Mathematics using engaging, Marvel-themed comic narratives. By combining natural language processing, generative AI, computer vision, and speech synthesis, ComicMath transforms abstract mathematical concepts into interactive, visual, and auditory learning experiences.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Highlights

- Converts math topics into comic scripts using the **Mistral Large Language Model API**
- Generates stylized comic panels from text using **Stable Diffusion**
- Maps dialogues to characters in each panel using **face detection** techniques
- Stores and handles dialogues in structured **JSON** format
- Enables interactive **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** playback for each comic panel
- Offers a multimodal AI experience using **NLP**, **CV**, and **generative modeling**

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Mistral LLM API** â€“ for narrative/script generation
- **Stable Diffusion** â€“ for generating comic visuals
- **OpenCV** â€“ for face detection and image mapping
- **JSON** â€“ for dialogue storage and manipulation
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** â€“ for interactive audio playback
- **NLP & Computer Vision (CV)** techniques
